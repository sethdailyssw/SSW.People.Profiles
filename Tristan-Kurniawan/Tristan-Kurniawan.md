Trainer, blogger and presenter, Tristan Kurniawan has dedicated himself to website interface development for over 8 years and is a pioneer in User eXperience (UX). Tristan has extensive experience of intranet, extranet, ecommerce content management and general internet applications by merging his concept development and design experience with rich media and CSS design.

We also think Tristan is the best skinner in Australia for DotNetNuke pages.
